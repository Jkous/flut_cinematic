## Getting Started üöÄ

> First, create the file `launch.json` in the `.vscode` folder following the example `launch.json.example`, and add the values of the `dart-define (Environment variables)` in the `toolArgs` parameter.

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

Can you add `Environment variables` for all flavors,

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Flut Cinematic works on iOS, Android._

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [slang](https://pub.dev/packages/slang) type-safe i18n solution using JSON files.

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable strings, open the `myFeatureName.json` file at `lib/i18n/en/myFeatureName.json`.

```json
{
    "appName": "Flut Cinematic"
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```json
{
    "appName": "Flut Cinematic"
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:flut_cinematic/i18n/translations.g.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Text(texts.misc.appName);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new Json file in `lib/i18n`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ i18n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ misc.json
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myFeature.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ misc.json
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myFeature.json
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.json` file:

> IMPORTANT: slang does not support \_ or - for file names. You must use camelcase. Example `myFeatureName.json`

`i18n/en/myFeatureName.json`

```json
{
    "appName": "Flut Cinematic",
    "movie": "Movie"
}
```

`i18n/es/myFeatureName.json`

```json
{
    "appName": "Flut Cinematic",
    "movie": "Pel√≠cula"
}
```

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translations changes, you will need to generate them:

1. Generate localizations for the current project:

```sh
dart run slang
```
